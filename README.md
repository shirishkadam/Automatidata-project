*This activity has three parts:*

**Part 1:** Ethical considerations 
* Consider the ethical implications of the request 

* Should the objective of the model be adjusted?

**Part 2:** Feature engineering

* Perform feature selection, extraction, and transformation to prepare the data for modeling

**Part 3:** Modeling

* Build the models, evaluate them, and advise on next steps
